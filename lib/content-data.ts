export const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What is a living trust?",
    answer: "A living trust is a legal document that places your assets into a trust during your lifetime. It allows your estate to avoid probate, keeps your affairs private, and ensures a smooth transfer of assets to your beneficiaries.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a will if I have a trust?",
    answer: "Yes, we recommend having both. A pour-over will catches any assets not transferred to your trust and allows you to name guardians for minor children.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the process take?",
    answer: "Most clients complete their estate plan in about 30 minutes online. Documents are typically ready for review within 24-48 hours.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this legally valid in all 50 states?",
    answer: "Yes, our documents are customized for your state's specific requirements and are legally valid across all 50 states.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in the Complete Estate Plan?",
    answer: "The Complete Estate Plan includes: Living Trust, Pour-Over Will, Durable Power of Attorney, Healthcare Directive, HIPAA Authorization, and Guardianship Designations.",
